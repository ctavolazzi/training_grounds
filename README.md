 An arena where different Python class objects can be pitted against one another in a battle to the death! (and I can learn how to code in Python while also building something goofy and fun)

UPDATE: v1.0

It works!

Fork and download the repo and run app.py in your favorite Python interpreter.

This is a battle royale fight to the death between any number of randomly generated warriors.

The code is MESSY and spaghettified but it works.

Run app.py in a terminal window and you will see an option:
"How many Warriors?"

Input any number here, but for the sake of your computer try to keep it under 100,000.

You will then see another question in your terminal:
"How many Items?"

The Warriors only pick up one Item at the beginning. Inputting a number greater than the number of Warriors is possible, but doesn't really do anything.

The app will then randomly generate your inputted number of Warriors and Items and print their names and attributed out in the terminal.

It will ask you one final question:
"(Y)(N)?"

Input "Y" to run the battle simulation.

The Warriors will fight to the death until only one remains.

The log of the fights will print out in the terminal, and at the end of the simulation the Final Warrior will be shown.

Check out the Warrior's memory to see how they came out on top.

Hi, 

It's me, the guy who wrote this game.

I wanted to make a game where you could randomly generate enemies and make them fight each other in a big battle royale.

For me, this project was a way to learn the basics of Python in a fun and goofy way. 

I realize this code is stringy spaghetified trash and I'm thinking about refactoring the app but I have a full-time job I need to prioritize. I got in trouble for working on this app at work, but holy crap was it fun.

I started completely from scratch with no coding experience in Python. I read the docs, learned the basic syntax, and then started coding.

If you look through the code, you'll see all kinds of commented out lines. These are some of the ideas that didn't work. I didn't clean them up because I want to look back in a few months when I have more experience with Python. I wanna see if what I learn in the next half a year and what I naturally tried end up being related - this is a learning experiment after all.

For me, this represents an achievement. 

In a little over two weeks I was able to code, from scratch, a working MVP of a simple randomly generated text-based battle royale simulator. 

I put probably 50 hours total into this project, and I can't wait to see what I'm ablt to create next. 

Thank you,

Chris
